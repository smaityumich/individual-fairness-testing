WARNING:tensorflow:Inconsistent references when loading the checkpoint into this object graph. Either the Trackable object references in the Python program have changed in an incompatible way, or the checkpoint was generated in an incompatible program.

Two checkpoint references resolved to different objects (<tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense object at 0x2b084cbae208> and <tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense object at 0x2b084cbae9b0>).
WARNING:tensorflow:No training configuration found in save file, so the model was *not* compiled. Compile it manually.
