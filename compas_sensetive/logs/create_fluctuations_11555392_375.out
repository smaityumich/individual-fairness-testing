WARNING:tensorflow:Inconsistent references when loading the checkpoint into this object graph. Either the Trackable object references in the Python program have changed in an incompatible way, or the checkpoint was generated in an incompatible program.

Two checkpoint references resolved to different objects (<tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense object at 0x2b86f562bf60> and <tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core.Dense object at 0x2b86f42596d8>).
WARNING:tensorflow:No training configuration found in save file, so the model was *not* compiled. Compile it manually.
